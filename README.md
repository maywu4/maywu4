### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a results driven software engineer with experience in building web applications using modern frameworks and languages. I'm proficient in Python, JavaScript, React/Redux, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and SQL. 


My portfolio projects include:
- :dollar: [Monetary Gain on the Brain](https://maywu4.github.io/javascript_project/): A single page data visualization application that forecasts how much an amount grows depending on various investments.
- :camera_flash: [MomentCaptur](https://momentcaptur.herokuapp.com/): A photography sharing application inspired by Flickr where users can create photo posts, create comments, and like posts.
- :musical_note: [WaveSense](https://wavesense.onrender.com/): A single-page audio visualizer application where users can select available songs or load local files and see a visual display of movements based on audio waves.

From my previous work experience at Ernst & Young and Citigroup, I possess exceptional skills in time management, collaborative teamwork, clear communication, and exposure to fast-paced environments which enabled me to hone my competencies working efficiently under pressure. I am actively seeking opportunities to undertake new challenges that will further demonstrate and improve my technical skills.
