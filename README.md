### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a recent graduate of App Academy, a full stack software engineering program. My portfolio projects include: Monetary Gain on the Brain, MomentCaptur, and WaveSense. Monetary Gain on the Brain is a data visualization application that shows how much a specified user inputted amount grows depending on various investments. MomentCaptur is a fullstack project with React/Redux on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend. It is a Flickr clone, where users can create photo posts, add comments on othersâ€™ posts, and favorite posts. WaveSense is a one page audio visualizer application created utilizing the MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (MERN) stack. 

Prior to software engineering, I primarily worked in public accounting as an auditor in the Real Estate industry.

Currently, my hobbies include reading mystery novels and learning to play chess.
